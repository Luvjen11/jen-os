                <h1>Jennifer Ogechi Okeke</h1>
                <p>I’m an Igbo Nigerian girl born and raised in Italy. Somehow ended up in the UK trying to act like I have my life together. 
                    Spoiler: I don’t, but I’m really good at making Notion dashboards that say otherwise.

                My love for tech didn’t start with some dramatic “I built my first computer at age 5” moment. It was more like “oooh I wanna learn that and that and that too”. Suddenly I went from cute little HTML to being in a situationship with Mr Java and Miss React.
                Now I’m over here building digital tools to automate my life because if something can be done by code, why should I suffer? 
                And along the way, I realized I actually enjoy building things that help people feel more organized, more empowered, and a little less chaotic, even if the world is doing its best to be messy.
